<strong><p style="color:#b3bf35">THE RESTAURANT</p></strong>
<p>SIGNS is a 150-seater upper casual dining &amp; bar restaurant and the first Canadian restaurant that is staffed with deaf servers. Our Vision is threefold:<br>
(i) To become one of the best restaurants in Canada<br>
(ii) To promote the use of American Sign Language amongst the hearing community<br>
(iii) To provide career opportunities and growth for the Deaf in the hospitality industry</p>
<p>The restaurant will appeal to a wide and varied clientele living across the GTA, as well as to tourists visiting Toronto.</p>
<p>SIGNS is a distinctive restaurant located at Yonge and Wellesley intersection just south of Bloor Street in Downtown Toronto. Our hours of operation are 11 AM to 12 AM.</p>

<strong><p style="color:#b3bf35">THE EXPERIENCE</p></strong>
<p><strong>Come for the experience, Stay for the food </strong><br>
Located at the lively Yonge and Wellesley intersection in Downtown Toronto area, SIGNS is an upper casual dining restaurant and the first Canadian restaurant that is staffed with deaf servers.  From a high quality contemporary menu with a blend of Canadian and International food along with our exquisite wine list, it is an excellent choice for a special evening, for a formal business meeting, and of course, for tourists. The restaurant is also a great place for the deaf community where they can find themselves at ease using their native language.</p>
<p><strong>We Sign, We Shine</strong><br>
SIGNS is undeniably one of a kind restaurant. Our well-trained staff will provide you with an experience that you cannot find anywhere, at any restaurant. Your experience will be much more than just great food &#8211; the warm atmosphere, the joy and intimacy, the overall ambience and feel of the place.</p>

<strong><p style="color:#b3bf35">THE AMBIENCE</p></strong>
<p>SIGNS will have a casual ambience with an upscale feel, against the backdrop of some elegant interior d√©cor, a setting that will make our guests feel cozy and comfortable, in addition to enjoying the experience of a unique service.</p>
<p>SIGNS Restaurant offers a unique opportunity for its guests to use American Sign Language (ASL) as a communication tool with its staff. Although there are few restaurants employing deaf staff in other parts of the world, SIGNS will have a more interesting concept of guests using ASL to order their food with the help of instructions given in the Menu. Guests will not only experience exceptional service, but will also enjoy learning the language while interacting with SIGNS deaf staff.</p>
